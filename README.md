### Description
RecruitmentSystem is a project developed for the KTH course Design of Global Application(IV1201). 
In short this program is a 'recruitment-system' used by a 'amusementpark company'. 
It is a full-stack application where the user interface is presented as a webpage. Here applicants can for example create accounts, login 
and apply for jobs. Likewise the 'company employees' can login and review these applications. 

This project was a mandatory requirement in passing the course. For higer grades additional options and 
functionality could be added, for example secruity, testing and logging.
